Project Objective

Build a full-stack smart expense splitting platform that allows groups to track shared expenses, automatically split bills, simplify debts, analyze spending patterns, and settle balances — all in real time.
The app should be more powerful and intelligent than Splitwise.

🛠 Mandatory Tech Stack (Do NOT change)
Frontend

React.js (Vite)

Tailwind CSS

Zustand (state management)

React Router DOM

Axios

Shadcn/UI components

Recharts (charts & analytics)

Backend

Node.js

Express.js

MongoDB + Mongoose

JWT Authentication

bcryptjs

WebSockets (Socket.IO)

OCR API (for bill scanning)

OpenAI API (AI insights)

CORS

dotenv

🔐 Authentication & Authorization

User Register / Login / Logout

JWT-based protected routes

Password hashing

User profile management

📌 Core Features (Must Implement)
👥 1. Groups & Members

Create expense groups (Trip, Flatmates, Friends, Office)

Add / remove members

Group roles (Admin / Member)

💰 2. Smart Expense Management

User can add:

Expense title

Total amount

Paid by (single or multiple users)

Split type:

Equal split

Percentage split

Exact amount split

Category (Food, Travel, Rent, Shopping)

Notes & date

App automatically calculates:

Who owes whom

Exact balance per user

📸 3. Bill Scan (OCR)

Upload bill image

OCR extracts:

Amount

Items

Auto-create expense from bill

🔁 4. Debt Simplification Algorithm

Implement algorithm to:

Minimize number of transactions

Settle balances efficiently

Example:

A owes B ₹500, B owes C ₹500 →
A directly pays C ₹500

💬 5. Group Chat (Real-Time)

Real-time group chat using WebSockets

Expense-linked messages

Typing indicator

📊 6. Expense Analytics Dashboard

Show:

Monthly spending

Category-wise breakdown

Who spends most

Who owes most

Visual charts & summaries

🧠 7. AI Spending Insights

Using OpenAI:

Monthly spending summary

Suggestions to reduce expenses

Detect overspending patterns

(Return mock response if API key missing)

🗂 8. Expense History & Activity Log

Track:

Added expense

Settlements

Member actions

Who paid / who settled

💸 9. Settlements

Mark expense as paid

Partial payments

Settlement history

Balance reset after settlement

🎨 UI / UX Requirements

Clean modern finance-style UI

Mobile-first responsive design

Dark / Light mode

Smooth animations

Clear balance indicators (green/red)
